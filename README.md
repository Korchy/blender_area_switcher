# Area Switcher
Area Switcher - Blender 3D add-on for quickly switching work areas.

Add-on functionality
-
Switching work areas in Blender is usually done by pressing a button that calls up a menu, and then selecting the desired work area type. At the same time, some areas in the work pipeline switch back and forth much more often than others. For example "Outliner" with "Properties" or "3D View" with "Shader Editor". With the "Area Switcher" add-on, you can quickly switch such areas at a single button click, without having to select them from the menu, which generally speeds up the workflow.

The add-on appends an additional button to the area header, by pressing which the work area immediately switches to the desired type.

The add-on is fully customizable. From which workspace and to which one the switching will take place is configured by the user in the add-on properties. You can also configure the switching of several work areas one after another.
